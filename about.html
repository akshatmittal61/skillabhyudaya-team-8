<div class="cardcontent" id="cardcontent7">
    In FORCE we maintain a high level of respect towards everyone and we expect everyone to follow our Code Of Conduct.
<p>
    <ul class="fa-ul">
     <li>Be friendly and welcoming</li>
     <li>Be patient Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language. (Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.)</li>
     <li>Being thoughtful Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.</li>
     <li>Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.</li>
     <li>Be respectful In particular, respect differences of opinion.</li>
     <li>Be charitable: Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.
When we do disagree, try to understand why.</li>
     <li>Avoid destructive behavior: Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.</li>
     <li>Unconstructive criticism: don’t merely decry the current state of affairs; offer—or at least solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.</li>
     <li>Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)</li>
     <li>Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.</li>
     <li>Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral and environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a person or group</li>
     <li>Be mindful of your language. Any of the following behavior is unacceptable
Offensive comments related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, or background</li>
     <li>Threats of violence</li>
     <li>Deliberate intimidation.</li>
     <li>Sexually explicit or violent material</li>
     <li>Unwelcome sexual attention</li>
     <li>Stalking or following</li>
     <li>Or any other kinds of harassment  </li>
    </ul>
